        Norway
    </p>
    <p class="p1">
        Norway, officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a Nordic country in Northern Europe, the mainland territory of <br>
        which comprises the western and northernmost portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula. The remote Arctic island of
        <br>
        Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard also form part of Norway. Bouvet Island, located in the <br>
        Subantarctic, is a dependency of Norway; it also lays claims to the Antarctic territories of Peter I Island and
        <br>
        Queen Maud Land. The capital and largest city in Norway is Oslo. <br>

        Population and Geography
    </p>

    <p class="p2">
        Norway has a total area of 385,207 square kilometres (148,729 sq mi) and had a population of 5,425,270 in <br>
        January 2022. The country shares a long eastern border with Sweden at a length of 1,619 km (1,006 mi). It is
        <br>
        bordered by Finland and Russia to the northeast and the Skagerrak strait to the south, on the other side of <br>
        which are Denmark and the United Kingdom. Norway has an extensive coastline, facing the North Atlantic Ocean and
        <br>
        the Barents Sea. The maritime influence dominates Norway's climate, with mild lowland temperatures on the sea
        <br>
        coasts; the interior, while colder, is also significantly milder than areas elsewhere in the world on such <br>
        northerly latitudes. Even during polar night in the north, temperatures above freezing are commonplace on the
        <br>
        coastline. The maritime influence brings high rainfall and snowfall to some areas of the country. <br>

    <p class="p5">
        Climate
    </p>

    <p class="p4">
        The southern and western parts of Norway, fully exposed to Atlantic storm fronts, experience more precipitation
        <br>
        and have milder winters than the eastern and far northern parts. Areas to the east of the coastal mountains are
        <br>
        in a rain shadow, and have lower rain and snow totals than the west. The lowlands around Oslo have the warmest
        <br>
        summers, but also cold weather and snow in wintertime. The sunniest weather is along the south coast, but <br>
        sometimes even the coast far north can be very sunny - the sunniest month with 430 sun hours was recorded in
        <br>
        Troms√∏ <br> <br>
        Because of Norway's high latitude, there are large seasonal variations in daylight. From late May to late July,
        <br>
        the sun never completely descends beneath the horizon in areas north of the Arctic Circle (hence Norway's <br>
        description as the "Land of the Midnight sun"), and the rest of the country experiences up to 20 hours of <br>
        daylight per day. Conversely, from late November to late January, the sun never rises above the horizon in the
        <br>
        north, and daylight hours are very short in the rest of the country.

        Biodiversity
    </p>

    <p class="p6" align="right">
        The total number of species include 16,000 species of insects (probably 4,000 more species yet to be described), <br>
        20,000 species of algae, 1,800 species of lichen, 1,050 species of mosses, 2,800 species of vascular plants, up <br>
        to 7,000 species of fungi, 450 species of birds (250 species nesting in Norway), 90 species of mammals, 45 <br>
        fresh-water species of fish, 150 salt-water species of fish, 1,000 species of fresh-water invertebrates, and <br>
        3,500 species of salt-water invertebrates. About 40,000 of these species have been described by science. <br>
        The red list of 2010 encompasses 4,599 species. Norway contains five terrestrial ecoregions: Sarmatic mixed <br>
        forests, Scandinavian coastal conifer forests, Scandinavian and Russian taiga, Kola Peninsula tundra, and <br>
        Scandinavian montane birch forest and grasslands. <br>
